                            <p>My name is Danial Tariq and I am a second-year student at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology studying Bachelor of Information Technology.
                             I was born and raised in Pakistan and moved to Australia in 2016.
                              I have completed grade 11 in Pakistan and then continued my studies in Australia.

                            <p>I’m Khavya Mahesh, I’m an International student from India, studying at RMIT University, currently pursuing Bachelor of Business Information System.
                             I’ve been in Melbourne for about 3 years now, and have found this place to be completely diverse from the place where I come from as in India,
                              I used to lead a life with an unique culture that is followed which is very traditional where people follow different religions, speak different languages and so on.
                               My hobbies are photography, playing basketball, listening to music etc.
                                At first I thought I’ll do some business only related course and it just struck me back then how I always wanted to know how all these application in any mobile device work or how exactly a computer operates
                                 and I thought to myself if I’m going to become an Entrepreneur, I should not only train myself to be good in the business side but also the technology point of view,
                                  and other major things that gave me an idea of opting for a business course combined with IT touch in it and that’s exactly how my interest in IT field expanded. Our chosen Team name is Tech_squads.

                            <p>My name is Alex Chan and I am from Bairnsdale, a small regional town in eastern Victoria.
                             I was born in Australia and raised by my mother and father who both emigrated from Hong Kong to Australia.
                              While English is my first language, I can speak Cantonese at a conversational level with my relatives, but I do not have the ability to read or write in it.
                               During Years 11 and 12 I completed Computing and Software Development subjects as a part of my VCE, while they were not strictly prerequisites to my university degree,
                                having a sound understanding of the basics in computing was important. I have been studying at RMIT since 2019,
                                 currently it is my second year studying a Bachelor of Computer and Network Engineering.
                                  I have taken Introduction to Information Technology as an elective subject. Ever since I was a child,
                                   I have enjoyed playing single-player video games, such as open-world RPGs and indie games.
                                    I also have a large interest in computer hardware, especially surrounding gaming PCs.
                                     Anything from reading about the latest hardware news to building and customising my own desktop computer.
                                      I also own a dog, an 8-year-old Papillon named Radar who always loves to eat and sleep.

                        Within the process of this assignment, we went through internal discussion with the group to further improve of the artifact of our fitness application project idea. We went through the details of the current project including work flows of essential attributes and element in the major functionalities of our product. To better present our ideas to the audience, our team have investigate on the health/diet/sport mobile application product which are currently in the market. We make analysis and comparison of them to our project thought meeting consultation, and then decide the overall design of the product. With the rest of the time, our team spending most of it on designing and establishing the product GUI (Graphic User Interface) from paper design draft to the final of a series of presentation image of UI made with tools.

                        The differences between our Ideal jobs includes unique skills that are required for each of us to possess and also the way we attain them such as the non-highlighted part of the table above. Every job is different in its own way as their goal is unique and the purpose of performing those skills may vary depending on the requirements of the job positions.

                <h5><b>Github </b></h5>
                <p>GitHub is one software/tool that our group has used a lot as it allows the team the ability of distribution version control and source code management functionality. Whenever a modification or a change in a code is required, we can all manage to make changes through GitHub as it allows multiple people to work on a same file. GitHub is mainly used for programming aspects of our project which is a website. We will work together to complete tasks on to GitHub before uploading them onto our website.</p>

                <h5 class="bth3"><b>Google Docs</b></h5>
                <p>Google Docs is an online word processor that helps the group to work together as a team. Most of us already used this tool and we are quite familiar with it, so we decided to use this for research and to complete our assignment. </p>

                    The project idea is to create a ‘fitness’ application based on Australia for mobile devices that excels with a combination of sports, food and blog.
                    <Br> <b class="ppb">Sports -</b> The idea is to bring out a healthy and traditional way of being fit for the users for which the application consist of information
                    such as availability of the nearby grounds / players according to the user’s preferred location for them to engage in several sports
                    and also consist of various exercises to be followed.<Br> <b class="ppb">Food - </b>In this part consists various recipes to make at home, different diet plans,
                    and has an interesting option for the users to choose from the displayed food options which is awarded as healthy and tasty recipes and connects them to the
                    respective restaurants unlike other fitness application and also allow the users to make orders with the restaurant which will be kept prepared for the users
                    to take-away or the users can directly refer to the restaurant and visit them in person to dine-in directly by easing up the process for those people who tends
                    to hesitate to cook at home sometimes and still wants to keep up with the healthy meal plan, which would serve as a motivation and as well as help the users to
                    adopt a healthy life-style.<Br> <b class="ppb"> Blog - </b>This serves the main purpose of making the users want to use our
                    application, by maintaining a page for users to share their experience on using our application and how helpful it was, putting
                    up motivational videos, and also provides a local chat box facility for users to talk or share their perspectives to other users
                    which might help them realise that they are not alone in their weight-loss journey or in their difficult times.

                        which gives them the strength to be kept motivated. One of the other main reasons to implement a fitness application is the statistics

                            As soon as the application is opened after installation, the users will have to go through the login process for which they’ll
                            have to create a new account using their phone/email and by agreeing to all our privacy terms. Whereas, the existing users can

                <h4 class"ph2">SPORTS :-</h4>
                <p>
                    For the sports section, there are two main parts: Firstly, a service which allows users to locate sporting grounds and players that are nearby.
                    Secondly, access to online training virtual coaches.
                </p>
                <h5 class="ph2">Nearby Grounds/Players</h5>
                <p>
                    The intended function of this service is to assist sporting enthusiasts in finding nearby sporting grounds or courts.
                    As modern smartphones have the necessary GPS capabilities to locate individuals and locations, the app can use this to
                    allow the user to verify if particular grounds or courts are currently vacant or occupied. It would also provide
                    detailed descriptions of sporting venues, by listing the types of courts, whether it is an indoor or outdoor venue,
                    opening hours, public transportation available nearby and contact information about the local club. Each user will
                    also have their own profile, allowing users to locate one another and for finding coaches for improving their skills.
                    The users profiles can also allow users to add each other as contacts where they can communicate with each other
                    using the chat feature mentioned below. Other features that are included in this program include: The latest sporting
                    news, the results of previous matches played both at the social level and professional level, tutorial videos about
                    learning how to play particular sports, as well as upcoming tournament and match fixtures.
                </p>
                <h5 class="ph2">Online Training via Virtual Coach</h5>
                <p>
                    The online training service is an implementation of a virtual video session with a specified coach for users looking
                    for training assistance, similar to video conferencing tools such as Zoom, Skype, or FaceTime. Coaches can then
                    provide feedback, perform demonstrations, motivate, and provide advice to the user during their routine, as they
                    would in person. Furthermore, users will be able to set appointments with trainers, with options to choose from
                    such as: Available times for coaches, the type of sport they are participating in or which workout routine they
                    are following, the specific virtual coach they want to work with and also choosing to keep in touch with their coaches via the chat feature.
                </p>
                <h4 class"ph2">FOOD :-</h4>

                    items and much more including food for specific health problems. As the user selects a particular choice of recipe, they will be
                    provided with information such as the Nutrition Profile, Total time to cook, number of Servings, Ingredients(easily available at
                    most of the stores), Steps (Directions for cooking the recipe)  ,Facts(about ingredients), Tips to be more productive and Exchange
                    (If the user can’t find specific ingredient, then they can replace it with other ingredients) along with photos and video to help
                    for the same. The users will not only be able to view these but also review and add ratings, share it, print, or can save as their

                <p>
                    This helps the users to generate their own DIY diet plan or allows them to simply choose from the recommended diet plan
                    according to their needs (gain muscle, lose weight etc..). The Diet Plan will combine the Healthy Recipe we provide and use the
                    recommended ingredients and relative recipes into the diet. The page of Diet Plan will be displayed in the form of calendar memo,
                    and the screen of each individual date will include the Diet Plan already made. Users are flexible to change their Diet Plan at
                    any time. The corresponding Healthy meal will be set up with a link to relative Healthy Recipe. We need to back up some diet plans
                    corresponding to different requirements in the system for users' reference or selection.

                    food of their choice and decide to either pick-up or dine-in. Based on the selected option, the application connects them to the
                    respective restaurants which will further lead to a process where the food is prepared and kept ready for pick or the customers
                    can simply order from the restaurant.

                                What I imagine some of my fellow members were more than a little confident at the prospect of doing this assignment, I was also very positive about it. This is because each group member has different skills, and which helped all of us at some point during the assignment. All of us are good listeners and because of it everyone can better express themselves and their ideas, and allows me to develop my skills which will be vital in my future career: the ability to talk to people, obtain their attention, and establish a rapport. As such, I resolved to make sure that I put all my effort into it. However, my one major concern was that it was a group assignment, while organisational behaviour theory tells us that groups working together can achieve more than individuals working separately'; this depends on the compatibility of the team. As such, my biggest concern was that our team would not work well together, and our work may suffer as a result but while going through it everything was going great and realised it is just an assumption. In my part of coding GitHub was very useful as I can easily change my work via GitHub Desktop from changes made by fellow members. As I will commit my work and they can see it.

The things which I feel group can really work on is improving the communication as I noticed some of the team member are shy to talk but surprisingly the way everyone work was very professional.This assignment has demonstrated that a team is more than the sum of its component parts. Crucial to what we did was assessing and recognising our strengths and bringing them together to create something more powerful that any of us individually.  I think working in this group will help me to build required skill and confidence to achieve my ideal job.

                                I find my group to be very co-operative and confident in whatever we do. Every individual of our group uses their own strengths, capabilities, and express talent in a way that the tasks assigned for each of us are aimed to be perfectly completed by managing the given time and by delegating the activities extremely well among us. Our group tends to value other's choice and allows us to express other's point of view on any aspect. Everyone in our group has good listening skills which is a very important aspect to become a good team player for every individuals among the group, but some of us are still learning on how to communicate effectively and also be a good team player as we all have our own difficulties and also coming from a diverse background can be a barrier as it takes time to get comfortable with each other. I think our group is adjustable and doing well considering the fact that all of us have different taste and preferences of choices and also from different parts of the world with total different experience and knowledge which is also a benefit for our group as a whole as we get a chance to learn and gain knowledge based on other's experience.

                                From my point of view,it is so nice to meet such good teammates in this course! Each member is dedicated to this group assignment. To start out, time management does well in the whole process, for example, each week our group schedules two meetings and both of them went well.For what things could be improved, I think communication has some tiny issues when we are having a meeting.However, I think the biggest problem comes from myself, because this is my first time to go abroad and I need more time to get adapted to the language environment where people speak English fluently. What surprises me most was that our group is doing so well in terms of html and css, especially the model made by fellow members, which is extremely fantastic. The way to study IT for me is fairly tough, when I was doing the part of Industry data, I feel like my clumsy brain could not contain so much complicated knowledge.

                                For what was doing well, the group was active in organizing meetings and delegating the works of the assignment. Each of the members are willing to indicate what they are good at and work on the section they are familiar with. For what could be improved, I was being an introvert during the meeting which I wasn’t being positive to contribute my thoughts and being a part of delegation of work. Also, the meeting time of the group was usually arranged within 5:30 to 7:30pm which I normally cook my dinner at this period of time, and I was too shy to talk about this issue with my group. For what was surprising, although the group was working on the project together for the first time, everyone was able to enter the flow state very well. What’s more, when I was doing the report on industry data and read some burning glass data for the IT industry, I surprisingly found that some of the skills that I used to think were not that popular, come out they are ranking high in the reality. I learned that it is important for a group to divide the job appropriately for a team to work together and the good delegation of our work by my team members was allowing us to complete our jobs in a good manner.

                                Personally, I’ve had a positive experience working with my group. From what I observed, each member was capable of working in a team environment online, despite the restrictions in place due to COVID-19 preventing us from meeting in person. This was largely facilitated through Microsoft Teams, where we would agree on a specific time to meet via video link and discuss the necessary tasks needed to be completed by each individual member. I found that all members of the group were cooperative and diligent in their work, there weren’t any major disagreements with the allocation of the tasks or the direction of the project idea. On some occasions, there might have been some members who have missed a meeting or haven’t responded to messages, but eventually they followed through with the work that was set out. Our team has a diverse range of skills, while some of us are confident in coding and web design, others excelled in writing descriptive responses for the questions in the assignment. This allows us to utilise our strengths, by delegating tasks to members that match their skillset.

                        In order to carry out our assignment activities effectively and efficiently, the main aspects which went well among our group was: Delegation of work, time-management, and cooperation. Through using Microsoft Teams, each meeting would have an agenda where we would read over the assignment specification and understand what work was needed to be completed. In our team, we divided our work into subsections where some members would focus on specific tasks, e.g. designing the website, rewriting the document, finalising the documents for submission, etc. Regarding time management, our team was consistent in working from start to finish, there weren’t any instances of last-minute rushed work, as we set due dates for each section prior to the actual due date of submission. Lastly, cooperation was another key strength of our group. There were no cases of disagreement or arguments over the work set out for each member, we were all content on completing the work assigned to us.

                        The main aspect needing improvement was our communication skills. Some members in our group don’t excel in public speaking and had a bit of trouble conveying their progress on the assignment. As our group members come from diverse backgrounds, language barriers may contribute to this. However as a whole, we believe we can overcome this problem together in our future assignments and work towards addressing our common goal of delivering work to a high standard.

                        The main thing that surprised our group was the amount of dedication that each and every individual of our group willing to contribute in order to meet our timeline and devising feasible and achievable ideas for our project idea. Another aspect was that we met requirements for the rubric by meticulously reading through it, ensuring that all parts of the assignment were completed well.

                        The key things we learned during our time as a group was that by working in a team environment, helped us foster creativity, build up mutual trust and assisted us in learning ways to resolve problems by formulating a solution together as a group.
