                            <p>My name is Danial Tariq and I am a second-year student at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology studying Bachelor of Information Technology.
                             I was born and raised in Pakistan and moved to Australia in 2016.
                              I have completed grade 11 in Pakistan and then continued my studies in Australia.

                            <p>I’m Khavya Mahesh, I’m an International student from India, studying at RMIT University, currently pursuing Bachelor of Business Information System.
                             I’ve been in Melbourne for about 3 years now, and have found this place to be completely diverse from the place where I come from as in India,
                              I used to lead a life with an unique culture that is followed which is very traditional where people follow different religions, speak different languages and so on.
                               My hobbies are photography, playing basketball, listening to music etc.
                                At first I thought I’ll do some business only related course and it just struck me back then how I always wanted to know how all these application in any mobile device work or how exactly a computer operates
                                 and I thought to myself if I’m going to become an Entrepreneur, I should not only train myself to be good in the business side but also the technology point of view,
                                  and other major things that gave me an idea of opting for a business course combined with IT touch in it and that’s exactly how my interest in IT field expanded. Our chosen Team name is Tech_squads.

                            <p>My name is Alex Chan and I am from Bairnsdale, a small regional town in eastern Victoria.
                             I was born in Australia and raised by my mother and father who both emigrated from Hong Kong to Australia.
                              While English is my first language, I can speak Cantonese at a conversational level with my relatives, but I do not have the ability to read or write in it.
                               During Years 11 and 12 I completed Computing and Software Development subjects as a part of my VCE, while they were not strictly prerequisites to my university degree,
                                having a sound understanding of the basics in computing was important. I have been studying at RMIT since 2019,
                                 currently it is my second year studying a Bachelor of Computer and Network Engineering.
                                  I have taken Introduction to Information Technology as an elective subject. Ever since I was a child,
                                   I have enjoyed playing single-player video games, such as open-world RPGs and indie games.
                                    I also have a large interest in computer hardware, especially surrounding gaming PCs.
                                     Anything from reading about the latest hardware news to building and customising my own desktop computer.
                                      I also own a dog, an 8-year-old Papillon named Radar who always loves to eat and sleep.

                        Within the process of this assignment, we went through internal discussion with the group to further improve of the artifact of our fitness application project idea. We went through the details of the current project including work flows of essential attributes and element in the major functionalities of our product. To better present our ideas to the audience, our team have investigate on the health/diet/sport mobile application product which are currently in the market. We make analysis and comparison of them to our project thought meeting consultation, and then decide the overall design of the product. With the rest of the time, our team spending most of it on designing and establishing the product GUI (Graphic User Interface) from paper design draft to the final of a series of presentation image of UI made with tools.

                        The differences between our Ideal jobs includes unique skills that are required for each of us to possess and also the way we attain them such as the non-highlighted part of the table above. Every job is different in its own way as their goal is unique and the purpose of performing those skills may vary depending on the requirements of the job positions.

                <h5><b>Github </b></h5>
                <p>GitHub is one software/tool that our group has used a lot as it allows the team the ability of distribution version control and source code management functionality. Whenever a modification or a change in a code is required, we can all manage to make changes through GitHub as it allows multiple people to work on a same file. GitHub is mainly used for programming aspects of our project which is a website. We will work together to complete tasks on to GitHub before uploading them onto our website.</p>

                <p>
                    The project idea is to create a ‘fitness’ application based on Australia for mobile devices that excels with a combination of sports, food and blog.
                    <Br> <b class="ppb">Sports -</b> The idea is to bring out a healthy and traditional way of being fit for the users for which the application consist of information
                    such as availability of the nearby grounds / players according to the user’s preferred location for them to engage in several sports
                    and also consist of various exercises to be followed.<Br> <b class="ppb">Food - </b>In this part consists various recipes to make at home, different diet plans,
                    and has an interesting option for the users to choose from the displayed food options which is awarded as healthy and tasty recipes and connects them to the
                    respective restaurants unlike other fitness application and also allow the users to make orders with the restaurant which will be kept prepared for the users
                    to take-away or the users can directly refer to the restaurant and visit them in person to dine-in directly by easing up the process for those people who tends
                    to hesitate to cook at home sometimes and still wants to keep up with the healthy meal plan, which would serve as a motivation and as well as help the users to
                    adopt a healthy life-style.<Br> <b class="ppb"> Blog - </b>This serves the main purpose of making the users want to use our
                    application, by maintaining a page for users to share their experience on using our application and how helpful it was, putting
                    up motivational videos, and also provides a local chat box facility for users to talk or share their perspectives to other users
                    which might help them realise that they are not alone in their weight-loss journey or in their difficult times.

                        Doing regular exercise is essential for everyone under normal circumstances as it helps people live a longer, healthier and a happy life.
                        Although, it is these times like covid-19 makes it not possible for people at any age considering that they workout almost everyday or
                        even barely, who might even find it difficult to follow a proper diet plan due to the frustration, depression or even because of the time
                        they spend mostly at home in-order to stop the spread of covid-19 making it easy to forget the daily routine and leading to stress-eat,
                        that can be caused because of the lockdown implemented with concern to the pandemic. The government of Australia suggests that it is
                        important to stay active in-order to reduce the risk of health conditions like stroke and heart disease, to control gaining more weight,
                        to reduce stress and anxiety caused by this pandemic, and to improve sleep.
                        This application not only provides benefit during the normal times by helping in boosting up the immune system which might be of a great
                        help to an individual to help prepare their body to fight against any virus leading them to fall sick, but also during such difficult
                        times like covid-19 where one doesn’t want to go to gym, health clubs or fitness centres physically but just use our application instead
                        which gives them the strength to be kept motivated. One of the other main reasons to implement a fitness application is the statistics
                        below showing the projected growth of users using fitness applications from 2017 to 2022 which is to be increased from 62.7 million to 87.4 million users.

                    Other similar applications to fitness that are available in the market includes - Daily Yoga - teaches yoga using videos, Foodility - allows to track food habits, Nourishly - Connects users to well trained medical team, Yummy Recipes + Shopping List - suggests recipes based on dietary restrictions and allergies, Waterlogged - focuses on keeping the users hydrated, and other meditation, mental health and dance related applications.

                <p>Our competitors are as follows:</p>
                <p>MyFitnessPal - One of the popular applications containing 6 million food suggestions. Allows users to set exercise and diet goals.</p>
                <p>Lose It - is another health tracker that includes an easy-to-use food diary and exercise log. Allows to connect a pedometer or other fitness device.</p>
                <p>Other competitors include Noom, Fatsecret, S Health etc.</p>
                <p>All the applications which are stated above are focused on delivering customer satisfaction through giving in some valuable ideas to improve the health and lifestyle for all that matters which is quite similar to our fitness application. But, what we deliver is different comparing to other applications out there as we have created an opportunity for our users where they can find several unique aspects such as sports - including suggestions showing nearby grounds, players to play with etc, Food - Providing healthy recipes, recipes that can be ordered / dine-in directly, Blog - Providing motivation and allows to share successful stories of users all in one platform.</p>

            <h2 class="ph2">Detailed Description :-</h2>
            <h3 class="ph2">Aims</h3>
            <div class="pp">
                <p>
                    The aim is to have the fitness application prototype fully completed as the primary objective of this project. The application comprises of three main features, a sports service that enables users to seek out nearby sporting grounds and players, meanwhile the virtual coach application will allow users to connect with a personal trainer, group training session or attend a session for general inquiries. The second feature is a food service which presents a series of healthy recipes to choose from that caters to varying dietary requirements as well as a food ordering system that allows the user to search for local healthy eateries. The blog and community aspect allows users to write about their own experiences related to fitness and have a space for the community to discuss a range of topics related to anything related to health or fitness. The deliverable that our group will present is a functioning prototype of the mobile application that has all the proposed user interface elements and functions of the app, including graphical designs, icons and buttons. We chose to develop a prototype using an online program named Marvel that enables us to emulate the appearance of a mobile device without having to manually code an actual application. This method is a viable option as it is an efficient method of getting the design and functionality in place, while being simple for our group members to use. 
                </p>
                <p>Goal One: Devise the necessary functions and features of the application.</p>
                <p>Our first goal is to come up with all the necessary functions and features needed in the application. To reach this goal we were required to discuss and brainstorm the concept, everything from the colour scheme of the application, what icons are needed on the taskbar, the placement of user interface elements and most importantly, the functionality of each of the three sections. This goal is crucial, as a good foundation is required for understanding the direction and scope of this application. The sports section requires the implementation of Google Maps and a search bar, while the virtual coach section requires a booking system and a video call service to connect with their coaches. For the food section, a database of healthy food recipes is required, the implementation of a food ordering service and a connection to a payment system would be added to application. For the blog and community section of the app, it would need to be connected to social media platforms, where they can also display articles written by users themselves on the blog. The chat feature is available to all users and would also link with the sports section, allowing users to communicate either between players in their community or their personal trainers.</p>
                <p>Goal Two: Design the user interface (UI) elements of the application on prototyping software.</p>
                <p>The second goal is to be completed once the initial drafting and conception phase is complete. Using Marvel to design the prototype, our group will set out to each design a part of the app that demonstrates the intended functions described above. In this stage, the overall appearance of the application as well as the UI elements will be implemented, such as a taskbar to navigate between features, notifications, the layout of the buttons and graphics for logos and icons. The main reason for this particular goal is to demonstrate a tangible piece of the project that can highlight the key functionality of the fitness application. This goal is a major priority in this assignment as it actually shows our skills being applied into developing a proper concept of the fitness app and acts as a supplement to this report. A major part of our work effort has been directed at getting the prototype complete and fully functional. As Marvel can emulate the app’s function, we are able to demonstrate how the app navigates between pages and has working buttons, taskbar and notifications tab.</p>
                <p>Goal Three: Develop the application through Android and Apple SDKs to run on mobile devices.</p>
                <p>This goal is intended to extend beyond the current scope of our deliverable and is more of a future goal to strive towards, whether it be handed over to a development team or a future idea to be implemented once our skills have been developed further. Therefore, it can be considered as an extension of our project which discusses the technical aspects of app development. Once the prototype is completed, the next step would be to develop it into a fully functional application, where it can be run on both Apple and Android mobile devices. One major factor in actually publishing the app is the costs associated with obtaining a membership or registration for the Apple Developer Program/Android Development. Secondly, app development would require a high level of understanding in Swift and Java languages, meaning that we would have to source a team of developers or learn the skills ourselves over time.</p>

To achieve all these functions, software engineering knowledge is essential, because without software engineering, this application could not show up even if the content is so amazing for users to use.

With regard to investment, advertisements should be taken into consideration. To acquire more attention from the public, it is rational to make a suitable and proper way to advertise.

            <div class="pp">
                <p>Hard to achieve or accomplish the specific knowledge that would be used into application, leading to poor assignment given. If someone really causes some problems, which would reduce the efficiency of other group members, because the group, as a whole, it is common to help with each other.</p>
                <p>Have no time to do this application, because everyone is engaged in not only one class, all of us would contribute our time into other subjects. Codes which are needed must acquire a long time to run.</p>
                <p>(In the long term) Firstly, to accomplish the various functions which would be applied in our fitness application. Complicated knowledge must be required in a large amount, because it is hard to master these intelligences in a limited time. As a result, if the knowledge we learnt is not very well as expected, perhaps the scheduled time would be extended, which would result in more investment wasted due to this failure of weak learning. What is more, users might come up with the idea that this application is not as good as other applications, which would lose potential customers.</p>
                <p>Secondly, during this developing period, numerous competitors would spring up, so it is also a big challenge for adapting to the quick changes of the market. The trend of the market is flexible, once this application is made, the users who are investigated in the very beginning of the process might be outdated and it could not be suitable for the new lifestyle. </p>

                                What I imagine some of my fellow members were more than a little confident at the prospect of doing this assignment, I was also very positive about it. This is because each group member has different skills, and which helped all of us at some point during the assignment. All of us are good listeners and because of it everyone can better express themselves and their ideas, and allows me to develop my skills which will be vital in my future career: the ability to talk to people, obtain their attention, and establish a rapport. As such, I resolved to make sure that I put all my effort into it. However, my one major concern was that it was a group assignment, while organisational behaviour theory tells us that groups working together can achieve more than individuals working separately'; this depends on the compatibility of the team. As such, my biggest concern was that our team would not work well together, and our work may suffer as a result but while going through it everything was going great and realised it is just an assumption. In my part of coding GitHub was very useful as I can easily change my work via GitHub Desktop from changes made by fellow members. As I will commit my work and they can see it.

Each member is dedicated towards this subject and help each other in this assignment. Everyone was on time during our group meeting apart from one or two occasion, but they watched the recording and completed their tasks which was also divided equally among all the team members. The things which I feel group can really work on is improving the communication as I noticed some of the team member are shy to talk but surprisingly the way everyone work was very professional.This assignment has demonstrated that a team is more than the sum of its component parts. Crucial to what we did was assessing and recognising our strengths and bringing them together to create something more powerful that any of us individually.  I think working in this group will help me to build required skill and confidence to achieve my ideal job.

                                I find my group to be very co-operative and confident in whatever we do. Every individual of our group uses their own strengths, capabilities, and express talent in a way that the tasks assigned for each of us are aimed to be perfectly completed by managing the given time and by delegating the activities extremely well among us. Our group tends to value other's choice and allows us to express other's point of view on any aspect. Everyone in our group has good listening skills which is a very important aspect to become a good team player for every individuals among the group, but some of us are still learning on how to communicate effectively and also be a good team player as we all have our own difficulties and also coming from a diverse background can be a barrier as it takes time to get comfortable with each other. I think our group is adjustable and doing well considering the fact that all of us have different taste and preferences of choices and also from different parts of the world with total different experience and knowledge which is also a benefit for our group as a whole as we get a chance to learn and gain knowledge based on other's experience.

                                From my point of view,it is so nice to meet such good teammates in this course! Each member is dedicated to this group assignment. To start out, time management does well in the whole process, for example, each week our group schedules two meetings and both of them went well.For what things could be improved, I think communication has some tiny issues when we are having a meeting.However, I think the biggest problem comes from myself, because this is my first time to go abroad and I need more time to get adapted to the language environment where people speak English fluently. What surprises me most was that our group is doing so well in terms of html and css, especially the model made by fellow members, which is extremely fantastic. The way to study IT for me is fairly tough, when I was doing the part of Industry data, I feel like my clumsy brain could not contain so much complicated knowledge.

                                For what was doing well, the group was active in organizing meetings and delegating the works of the assignment. Each of the members are willing to indicate what they are good at and work on the section they are familiar with. For what could be improved, I was being an introvert during the meeting which I wasn’t being positive to contribute my thoughts and being a part of delegation of work. Also, the meeting time of the group was usually arranged within 5:30 to 7:30pm which I normally cook my dinner at this period of time, and I was too shy to talk about this issue with my group. For what was surprising, although the group was working on the project together for the first time, everyone was able to enter the flow state very well. What’s more, when I was doing the report on industry data and read some burning glass data for the IT industry, I surprisingly found that some of the skills that I used to think were not that popular, come out they are ranking high in the reality. I learned that it is important for a group to divide the job appropriately for a team to work together and the good delegation of our work by my team members was allowing us to complete our jobs in a good manner.

                                Personally, I’ve had a positive experience working with my group. From what I observed, each member was capable of working in a team environment online, despite the restrictions in place due to COVID-19 preventing us from meeting in person. This was largely facilitated through Microsoft Teams, where we would agree on a specific time to meet via video link and discuss the necessary tasks needed to be completed by each individual member. I found that all members of the group were cooperative and diligent in their work, there weren’t any major disagreements with the allocation of the tasks or the direction of the project idea. On some occasions, there might have been some members who have missed a meeting or haven’t responded to messages, but eventually they followed through with the work that was set out. Our team has a diverse range of skills, while some of us are confident in coding and web design, others excelled in writing descriptive responses for the questions in the assignment. This allows us to utilise our strengths, by delegating tasks to members that match their skillset.

                        In order to carry out our assignment activities effectively and efficiently, the main aspects which went well among our group was: Delegation of work, time-management, and cooperation. Through using Microsoft Teams, each meeting would have an agenda where we would read over the assignment specification and understand what work was needed to be completed. In our team, we divided our work into subsections where some members would focus on specific tasks, e.g. designing the website, rewriting the document, finalising the documents for submission, etc. Regarding time management, our team was consistent in working from start to finish, there weren’t any instances of last-minute rushed work, as we set due dates for each section prior to the actual due date of submission. Lastly, cooperation was another key strength of our group. There were no cases of disagreement or arguments over the work set out for each member, we were all content on completing the work assigned to us.

                        The main aspect needing improvement was our communication skills. Some members in our group don’t excel in public speaking and had a bit of trouble conveying their progress on the assignment. As our group members come from diverse backgrounds, language barriers may contribute to this. However as a whole, we believe we can overcome this problem together in our future assignments and work towards addressing our common goal of delivering work to a high standard.

                        The main thing that surprised our group was the amount of dedication that each and every individual of our group willing to contribute in order to meet our timeline and devising feasible and achievable ideas for our project idea. Another aspect was that we met requirements for the rubric by meticulously reading through it, ensuring that all parts of the assignment were completed well.
