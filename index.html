                            <p>My name is Danial Tariq and I am a second-year student at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology studying Bachelor of Information Technology.
                             I was born and raised in Pakistan and moved to Australia in 2016.

                            <p>I’m Khavya Mahesh, I’m an International student from India, studying at RMIT University, currently pursuing Bachelor of Business Information System.
                             I’ve been in Melbourne for about 3 years now, and have found this place to be completely diverse from the place where I come from as in India,
                              I used to lead a life with an unique culture that is followed which is very traditional where people follow different religions, speak different languages and so on.
                               My hobbies are photography, playing basketball, listening to music etc.
                                At first I thought I’ll do some business only related course and it just struck me back then how I always wanted to know how all these application in any mobile device work or how exactly a computer operates
                                 and I thought to myself if I’m going to become an Entrepreneur, I should not only train myself to be good in the business side but also the technology point of view,
                                  and other major things that gave me an idea of opting for a business course combined with IT touch in it and that’s exactly how my interest in IT field expanded. Our chosen Team name is Tech_squads.

                            <p>My name is Alex Chan and I am from Bairnsdale, a small regional town in eastern Victoria.
                             I was born in Australia and raised by my mother and father who both emigrated from Hong Kong to Australia.
                              While English is my first language, I can speak Cantonese at a conversational level with my relatives, but I do not have the ability to read or write in it.
                               During Years 11 and 12 I completed Computing and Software Development subjects as a part of my VCE, while they were not strictly prerequisites to my university degree,
                                having a sound understanding of the basics in computing was important. I have been studying at RMIT since 2019,
                                 currently it is my second year studying a Bachelor of Computer and Network Engineering.
                                  I have taken Introduction to Information Technology as an elective subject. Ever since I was a child,
                                   I have enjoyed playing single-player video games, such as open-world RPGs and indie games.
                                    I also have a large interest in computer hardware, especially surrounding gaming PCs.
                                     Anything from reading about the latest hardware news to building and customising my own desktop computer.
                                      I also own a dog, an 8-year-old Papillon named Radar who always loves to eat and sleep.

                        Within the process of this assignment, we went through internal discussion with the group to further improve of the artifact of our fitness application project idea. We went through the details of the current project including work flows of essential attributes and element in the major functionalities of our product. To better present our ideas to the audience, our team have investigate on the health/diet/sport mobile application product which are currently in the market. We make analysis and comparison of them to our project thought meeting consultation, and then decide the overall design of the product. With the rest of the time, our team spending most of it on designing and establishing the product GUI (Graphic User Interface) from paper design draft to the final of a series of presentation image of UI made with tools.

                        The differences between our Ideal jobs includes unique skills that are required for each of us to possess and also the way we attain them such as the non-highlighted part of the table above. Every job is different in its own way as their goal is unique and the purpose of performing those skills may vary depending on the requirements of the job positions.

                <h5><b>Github </b></h5>
                <p>GitHub is one software/tool that our group has used a lot as it allows the team the ability of distribution version control and source code management functionality. Whenever a modification or a change in a code is required, we can all manage to make changes through GitHub as it allows multiple people to work on a same file. GitHub is mainly used for programming aspects of our project which is a website. We will work together to complete tasks on to GitHub before uploading them onto our website.</p>

                <p>Google Docs is an online word processor that helps the group to work together as a team. Most of us already used this tool and we are quite familiar with it, so we decided to use this for research and to complete our assignment. </p>

                <p>
                    The project idea is to create a ‘fitness’ application based on Australia for mobile devices that excels with a combination of sports, food and blog.
                    <Br> <b class="ppb">Sports -</b> The idea is to bring out a healthy and traditional way of being fit for the users for which the application consist of information
                    such as availability of the nearby grounds / players according to the user’s preferred location for them to engage in several sports
                    and also consist of various exercises to be followed.<Br> <b class="ppb">Food - </b>In this part consists various recipes to make at home, different diet plans,
                    and has an interesting option for the users to choose from the displayed food options which is awarded as healthy and tasty recipes and connects them to the
                    respective restaurants unlike other fitness application and also allow the users to make orders with the restaurant which will be kept prepared for the users
                    to take-away or the users can directly refer to the restaurant and visit them in person to dine-in directly by easing up the process for those people who tends
                    to hesitate to cook at home sometimes and still wants to keep up with the healthy meal plan, which would serve as a motivation and as well as help the users to
                    adopt a healthy life-style.<Br> <b class="ppb"> Blog - </b>This serves the main purpose of making the users want to use our
                    application, by maintaining a page for users to share their experience on using our application and how helpful it was, putting
                    up motivational videos, and also provides a local chat box facility for users to talk or share their perspectives to other users
                    which might help them realise that they are not alone in their weight-loss journey or in their difficult times.

                        Doing regular exercise is essential for everyone under normal circumstances as it helps people live a longer, healthier and a happy life.
                        Although, it is these times like covid-19 makes it not possible for people at any age considering that they workout almost everyday or
                        even barely, who might even find it difficult to follow a proper diet plan due to the frustration, depression or even because of the time
                        they spend mostly at home in-order to stop the spread of covid-19 making it easy to forget the daily routine and leading to stress-eat,
                        that can be caused because of the lockdown implemented with concern to the pandemic. The government of Australia suggests that it is
                        important to stay active in-order to reduce the risk of health conditions like stroke and heart disease, to control gaining more weight,
                        to reduce stress and anxiety caused by this pandemic, and to improve sleep.
                        This application not only provides benefit during the normal times by helping in boosting up the immune system which might be of a great
                        help to an individual to help prepare their body to fight against any virus leading them to fall sick, but also during such difficult
                        times like covid-19 where one doesn’t want to go to gym, health clubs or fitness centres physically but just use our application instead
                        which gives them the strength to be kept motivated. One of the other main reasons to implement a fitness application is the statistics
                        below showing the projected growth of users using fitness applications from 2017 to 2022 which is to be increased from 62.7 million to 87.4 million users.

                    Other similar applications to fitness that are available in the market includes - Daily Yoga - teaches yoga using videos, Foodility - allows to track food habits, Nourishly - Connects users to well trained medical team, Yummy Recipes + Shopping List - suggests recipes based on dietary restrictions and allergies, Waterlogged - focuses on keeping the users hydrated, and other meditation, mental health and dance related applications.
                </p>
                <p>Our competitors are as follows:</p>
                <p>MyFitnessPal - One of the popular applications containing 6 million food suggestions. Allows users to set exercise and diet goals.</p>
                <p>Lose It - is another health tracker that includes an easy-to-use food diary and exercise log. Allows to connect a pedometer or other fitness device.</p>
                <p>Other competitors include Noom, Fatsecret, S Health etc.</p>
                <p>All the applications which are stated above are focused on delivering customer satisfaction through giving in some valuable ideas to improve the health and lifestyle for all that matters which is quite similar to our fitness application. But, what we deliver is different comparing to other applications out there as we have created an opportunity for our users where they can find several unique aspects such as sports - including suggestions showing nearby grounds, players to play with etc, Food - Providing healthy recipes, recipes that can be ordered / dine-in directly, Blog - Providing motivation and allows to share successful stories of users all in one platform.</p>

            <h3 class="ph2">Aims</h3>
            <div class="pp">
                <p>
                    The aim is to have the fitness application prototype fully completed as the primary objective of this project. The application comprises of three main features, a sports service that enables users to seek out nearby sporting grounds and players, meanwhile the virtual coach application will allow users to connect with a personal trainer, group training session or attend a session for general inquiries. The second feature is a food service which presents a series of healthy recipes to choose from that caters to varying dietary requirements as well as a food ordering system that allows the user to search for local healthy eateries. The blog and community aspect allows users to write about their own experiences related to fitness and have a space for the community to discuss a range of topics related to anything related to health or fitness. The deliverable that our group will present is a functioning prototype of the mobile application that has all the proposed user interface elements and functions of the app, including graphical designs, icons and buttons. We chose to develop a prototype using an online program named Marvel that enables us to emulate the appearance of a mobile device without having to manually code an actual application. This method is a viable option as it is an efficient method of getting the design and functionality in place, while being simple for our group members to use. 
                </p>
                <p>Goal One: Devise the necessary functions and features of the application.</p>
                <p>Our first goal is to come up with all the necessary functions and features needed in the application. To reach this goal we were required to discuss and brainstorm the concept, everything from the colour scheme of the application, what icons are needed on the taskbar, the placement of user interface elements and most importantly, the functionality of each of the three sections. This goal is crucial, as a good foundation is required for understanding the direction and scope of this application. The sports section requires the implementation of Google Maps and a search bar, while the virtual coach section requires a booking system and a video call service to connect with their coaches. For the food section, a database of healthy food recipes is required, the implementation of a food ordering service and a connection to a payment system would be added to application. For the blog and community section of the app, it would need to be connected to social media platforms, where they can also display articles written by users themselves on the blog. The chat feature is available to all users and would also link with the sports section, allowing users to communicate either between players in their community or their personal trainers.</p>
                <p>Goal Two: Design the user interface (UI) elements of the application on prototyping software.</p>
                <p>The second goal is to be completed once the initial drafting and conception phase is complete. Using Marvel to design the prototype, our group will set out to each design a part of the app that demonstrates the intended functions described above. In this stage, the overall appearance of the application as well as the UI elements will be implemented, such as a taskbar to navigate between features, notifications, the layout of the buttons and graphics for logos and icons. The main reason for this particular goal is to demonstrate a tangible piece of the project that can highlight the key functionality of the fitness application. This goal is a major priority in this assignment as it actually shows our skills being applied into developing a proper concept of the fitness app and acts as a supplement to this report. A major part of our work effort has been directed at getting the prototype complete and fully functional. As Marvel can emulate the app’s function, we are able to demonstrate how the app navigates between pages and has working buttons, taskbar and notifications tab.</p>
                <p>Goal Three: Develop the application through Android and Apple SDKs to run on mobile devices.</p>
                <p>This goal is intended to extend beyond the current scope of our deliverable and is more of a future goal to strive towards, whether it be handed over to a development team or a future idea to be implemented once our skills have been developed further. Therefore, it can be considered as an extension of our project which discusses the technical aspects of app development. Once the prototype is completed, the next step would be to develop it into a fully functional application, where it can be run on both Apple and Android mobile devices. One major factor in actually publishing the app is the costs associated with obtaining a membership or registration for the Apple Developer Program/Android Development. Secondly, app development would require a high level of understanding in Swift and Java languages, meaning that we would have to source a team of developers or learn the skills ourselves over time.</p>

            <h3 class="ph2">Plans and Progress</h3>
            <div class="pp">
                <p>The initial conception of the idea began from a combination of ideas generated from previous group member’s assignments, either from Assignment 1 or another subject. During Assignment 2, all group members held a group meeting together on Microsoft teams where we all discussed what project ideas we had come up with individually. We initially took the concept of designing a mobile application to be well suited to the strengths of our group, as some members had already experience with prototyping software such as Figma during their studies in User Centred Design.</p>
                <p>The decision to base the app around fitness was a combination of applying a sports app used for locating players and grounds with a food delivery app. This eventually led to our group further refining the idea into an app centred around wellbeing and physical fitness, that could also function as a platform for users with similar interests to interact in the community section of our app, either through blog posts or discussions on the forums.</p>
                <p>Initially, our group proposed the idea of implementing a food delivery service into the application akin to Uber Eats, however we eventually decided to implement a dine-in and pick-up feature on the basis that it simplified the app’s functionality to focus more on the healthy recipe options and diet planning.</p>
                <p>Another feature discussed in our group was how accounts were to be implemented on the basis that not all users would be willing to share their personal details, as many would just want to use the basic functions of the app like a quick search around their suburban area for gyms, sporting grounds and healthy eateries. By implementing a guest feature, users that are sensitive with their personal information such as names, email addresses and phone numbers, wouldn't be barred from using the application. Whereas some users would want to calibrate their diet and workout routine, therefore by creating an account, they can have full access to the application’s features including making bookings with their trainer, access to the user profile and chat feature.</p>
                <p>The overall design of the app has undergone a series of changes throughout the prototyping stage, most notably the colour scheme and taskbar, which was originally a darker grey and only had four ions. Over time, the design was refined into a sleeker design, with a lighter grey background, consisting of labelled icons, which we considered to be more user friendly. Another new addition to the overall design of the app was the notification button in the top left corner and the user’s profile, where they could keep personalised information about their own diet plan, shopping list, blog posts and fitness routines catered specifically towards the individual user.</p>
                <p>Referring to the aims and goals previously mentioned above, upon completion of the assignment, we will have the aim and the first two goals completed. As shown in the prototype description, we have demonstrated all the features of the project idea that we have devised during the planning phase in goal one, and have completed the user interface elements of the application with all the necessary functions in place as described in Goal Two. As previously mentioned, Goal Three was created to serve as a future target to reach beyond the scope of this assignment. It serves as the final stage for an app development to pursue if the project concept is received well. </p>

            <div class="pp">
                <p>Our fitness application helps the users to live their life to the fullest extent by allowing our users to keep track of their daily exercise, participate in our community activities, consume healthy recipes by either following our tips or even buying from the outlets mentioned in our application, by taking part in sports and also by getting trained virtually. Health and fitness is always a priority among people but it's not easy for everyone to make up their mind to engage in activities that pave the way to good health and happiness. Our application’s goal is to change the perspective of our customers and help them get onto the track by motivating in ways to show we care for them with the help of our blog page. It is not just any fitness application, but it is the one and only that allows the users to participate in various forums making their life a lot more fun, exciting and engaging. Our deliverables focus on our customers happiness, their health, their day-to-day activities, turning them into fit and obedient people and also to make income from that. </p>
                <p>If someone asks for the result by implementing a application with regard to fitness, we’ll be able to show our growth, the number of users, number of success stories as we aim to change at least 1 out of 10 persons life by bringing them the best application of all time focusing on what it is best at which is guiding customers in a right way, teaching them how exactly everything is done and bringing our target market close to their goal of becoming healthy in their personalised way by indulging them with the opportunities. Our application will never be a bad example for someone who is fat nor be a factor that might make some people feel insecure. It is all about being healthy even when someone’s fat or lean and that is exactly what we’ll be trying with our given time.</p>
                <p>Our application may not be fully developed, as it still has a lot to give in to our customers. We first introduce our idea and perspectives to our users such as the idea of buying healthy food, giving diet recipes, or having a virtual coach which will constantly be updated according to the taste preferences, demand and supply, and technology. For now the users of Australia get to install the application from the App Store and later we are planning to expand our target market to different countries around the world according to the response rate. The users will be provided with their customised and favourite diet plans, exercise plan, and a lot more fun stuff. We are looking forward to adding more features for specific age groups like for old people, children and also infants, and planning to collaborate further with more exciting and popular brands in future to add more specifications in our application as we strive to increase our customer satisfaction rate at any level.</p>

To achieve all these functions, software engineering knowledge is essential, because without software engineering, this application could not show up even if the content is so amazing for users to use.

With regard to investment, advertisements should be taken into consideration. To acquire more attention from the public, it is rational to make a suitable and proper way to advertise.

            <div class="pp">
                <p>Hard to achieve or accomplish the specific knowledge that would be used into application, leading to poor assignment given. If someone really causes some problems, which would reduce the efficiency of other group members, because the group, as a whole, it is common to help with each other.</p>
                <p>Have no time to do this application, because everyone is engaged in not only one class, all of us would contribute our time into other subjects. Codes which are needed must acquire a long time to run.</p>
                <p>(In the long term) Firstly, to accomplish the various functions which would be applied in our fitness application. Complicated knowledge must be required in a large amount, because it is hard to master these intelligences in a limited time. As a result, if the knowledge we learnt is not very well as expected, perhaps the scheduled time would be extended, which would result in more investment wasted due to this failure of weak learning. What is more, users might come up with the idea that this application is not as good as other applications, which would lose potential customers.</p>
                <p>Secondly, during this developing period, numerous competitors would spring up, so it is also a big challenge for adapting to the quick changes of the market. The trend of the market is flexible, once this application is made, the users who are investigated in the very beginning of the process might be outdated and it could not be suitable for the new lifestyle. </p>

While all team members are important, a developer contributes the most of work to an append website, especially in the later stages. It is important for developers to have an understanding of multiple operation platforms in the modern industry. As far as market penetration, there are three main mobile platforms which are Android, iPhone, and Windows Phones. A developer is not only experienced and able to code in one platform but also is flexible enough to create apps across any platform for any devices.</p>

                                After spending a long period of time with members, there were a plethora of things to learn and improve myself with personal feedback given within the team. In this assignment there were much less problems faced than the previous one because now we know everyone's skills and how to use them to improve productivity of the group. This time planning and work distribution was effective which resulted in less confusion and more efficient work. Now members who were not interacting earlier now they started to take more part in discussion resulted in new ideas and more involvement in the team. Among the team we learned many things other than assignment which helped in gaining more knowledge and facts. Most important thing was, Members were supporting each other in their parts which is less seen among groups. This type of relation increased efficiency and trust among us. Group assignments are one of my favourite activities as I love to talk and love to work among groups instead of individuals.

Each member is dedicated towards this subject and help each other in this assignment. Everyone was on time during our group meeting apart from one or two occasion, but they watched the recording and completed their tasks which was also divided equally among all the team members. The things which I feel group can really work on is improving the communication as I noticed some of the team member are shy to talk but surprisingly the way everyone work was very professional.This assignment has demonstrated that a team is more than the sum of its component parts. Crucial to what we did was assessing and recognising our strengths and bringing them together to create something more powerful that any of us individually.  I think working in this group will help me to build required skill and confidence to achieve my ideal job.

Every individual of our group uses their own strengths, capabilities, and express talent in a way that the tasks assigned for each of us are aimed to be perfectly completed by focusing on time management. Everyone in our group has good listening skills which is a very important aspect to become a good team player among the group. As we all have our own difficulties since we come from diverse backgrounds can be a barrier as it takes time to get comfortable with each other, but when compared to Assignment 2, I’ve noticed improvement in communication and also some of us are keen to take initiative. Our group is well-adjustable and doing good considering the fact that all of us have different taste and preferences of choices and also from different parts of the world with total different experience and knowledge which is also a benefit for our group as a whole as we get a chance to learn and gain knowledge based on other's experience.

                                It is so nice to still interact with the same kind of group members in terms of this subject. Everyone is dedicated to their part and taking care of each other as well. Some small things have changed for myself, like in the very beginning of my joining into this group, I am reluctant or shy to express my feelings and opinions, however, through the support from my group members, it does change. Through the interactions with so many powerful and kind students, it reduces the pressure or stress on each one, because each member has different skills with regard to their diverse majors, which makes our work go more smoothly and efficiently. When encountering some problems, it is the cohesion and cooperation that makes our group stronger.

                                For what was doing well, the group was active on organizing meeting and delegate the works of the assignment. Each of the member are willing indicate what they are good at and work on the section they are familiar with.
For what could be improved, Due to the close duedate of assignments from other courses, I was absent from two meetings of the team, and I could not complete what I needed to done in a efficient manner. So I think for me personally, the ability of time management should be improved.
For what was surprising, although the group was working on the project together for the first time, but everyone was able to enter the flow state very well. What’s more, when I was doing the report on industry data and read some burning glass data for IT industry, I surprisingly found that some of the skills that I used to think they are not that need, comes out they are ranking high in the reality.
For what was surprising，When we were discussing how to generate the prototype of the product of our group's Project idea, I found that some the team member had the experience of making mobile phone software GUI before, and their previous works are very good. Which make me feel confident of the establishment of the prototype. 
I learned that it is important for a group to divide the job appropriately for a team to work together and the good delegation of our work by my team members were allowing us to complete out jobs in a good manner.

Each member works diligently and is able to deliver work to a great standard. I have seen an improvement with group cohesion as we are now more confident in communicating with each other as time has passed. A key strength of our group is that we divide the work equally towards team members and set key dates for completing our work prior to the due date, allowing us to hold each other accountable for our work and to ensure that we can deliver the assignment on a timely manner. These aspects were demonstrated particularly during prototyping, where all members were willing to develop skills in learning how to design user interfaces for a mobile application. It has been a pleasure working with this group this semester as all our members act cooperatively and positively.

                        In order to carry out our assignment activities effectively and efficiently, the main aspects which went well among our group was: Delegation of work, time-management, and cooperation. Through using Microsoft Teams, each meeting would have an agenda where we would read over the assignment specification and understand what work was needed to be completed. In our team, we divided our work into subsections where some members would focus on specific tasks, e.g. designing the website, rewriting the document, finalising the documents for submission, etc. Regarding time management, our team was consistent in working from start to finish, there weren’t any instances of last-minute rushed work, as we set due dates for each section prior to the actual due date of submission. Lastly, cooperation was another key strength of our group. There were no cases of disagreement or arguments over the work set out for each member, we were all content on completing the work assigned to us.

                        The main aspect needing improvement was our communication skills. Some members in our group don’t excel in public speaking and had a bit of trouble conveying their progress on the assignment. As our group members come from diverse backgrounds, language barriers may contribute to this. However as a whole, we believe we can overcome this problem together in our future assignments and work towards addressing our common goal of delivering work to a high standard.

                <h3 class="gh3">At least one thing that was surprising.</h3>
                <div class="rowb">
                    <p>
                        The main thing that surprised our group was the amount of dedication that each and every individual of our group willing to contribute in order to meet our timeline and devising feasible and achievable ideas for our project idea. Another aspect was that we met requirements for the rubric by meticulously reading through it, ensuring that all parts of the assignment were completed well.

                <h3 class="gh3">At least one thing that we have learned about groups.</h3>
                <div class="rowb">
                    <p>
                        The key things we learned during our time as a group was that by working in a team environment, helped us foster creativity, build up mutual trust and assisted us in learning ways to resolve problems by formulating a solution together as a group.
